[Automatic Reproduction]{.fragment} [of Workflows]{.fragment} [in Registries]{.fragment} [(Snakemake Workflow Catalog and Nf-core)]{.fragment}

## Why automatic reproducibility?

::: incremental
- Test the current state of reproducibility in practice
- Reproducible &colone; different team/machine + same code &rArr; consistent measurement [@acm_inc_staff_artifact_2020]
- True "research" reproducibility would need knowledge of the specific experiment
- Instead, look at crash-free reproducibility
- Crash-free reproducibility is necessary for resarch reproducibility
:::

## Why workflows?

::: incremental
- Workflow &colone; script that generates directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks
  - DAG edges specify data dependencies to other nodes
  - Usually each node runs in a container
- Workflow engine &colone; interpreter that runs the workflow and executes the DAG
- Workflow registry &colone; archive of workflows (e.g. GitHub)
- Workflows are easier to code than programs
  - Especially parallelism

# Research questions

::: incremental
0. Characterize the registries
1. How many workflows were crash-free reproducible?
2. Causes of crashes?
:::

# RQ0: Workflow registries

::: incremental
- Drawn from <https://workflows.community/>
:::

## Registry: nf-core [@ewels_nf-core_2020]

::: incremental
- Nextflow engine only
- Mostly multiomics users (genomics, proteomics, ...)
- Community-curated workflows for common tasks
- Nf-core workflows follow certain conventions
  - Have `./main.nf`
  - Define profile for Singularity, Docker
- 48 workflows
- All less than 4.5 years
- Hosted in GitHub, can be viewed at <https://nf-co.re>
:::

## Registry: Snakemake Workflow Catalog

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 36px;"}
- Snakemake engine only
- Mostly multiomics users (genomics, proteomics, ...)
- All GitHub repositories that follow certain standards
  - Have a snakefile in a specific place
- 2,045 workflows but only 53 workflows with GitHub releases
- Developers can customize the usage command with their run file `.snakemake-workflow-catalog.yml`
- Almost all less than 2.5 years
- Hosted in GitHub, can be viewed at <https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/>
:::

## Registry: WorkflowHub and Dockstore

::: incremental
- WorkflowHub.eu [@ferreira_da_silva_workflowhub_2020] and Dockstore
  - Multiple workflow engines &rArr; no automatic run commands
  - Future work
:::

## Results

| Quantity    | All | SWC | nf-core |
|-------------|-----|-----|---------|
| # workflows | 101 | 53  | 48      |
| # releases  | 584 | 333 | 251     |

# RQ1: % of automatic reproducibility

- The registries advertise a command which runs these repositories.
- We want to know how often this command works without manual input.

| % of releases with no crash                     | [28%]{.fragment} | [11%]{.fragment} | [51%]{.fragment} |

# RQ2: What are common error causes

---

::: incremental
1. Look at one unclassified crashing execution by hand.
   * Describe the high-level reason.
2. Write a regular expression to catch this kind of error.
   * Make sure it is exclusive with the other regular expressions.
3. Mark these as classified.
4. Repeat to 1
5. Spotcheck the results
:::

---

::: incremental
- Workflow task error
  - Timeout
  - Network resource changed
  - Missing software dependency
  - Other
- Workflow script error
  - Missing data/config input
  - Other
- Workflow engine error
  - Singularity error
  - Conda environment unsolvable
- Unclassified

## Observations

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 32px"}
- Misisng example data/config is prominent
  - SWC YAML run file does not have a place for example data
  - Sometimes the nf-core `test` profile is insufficient!
  - Workflows should default to example data (downloaded or generated)
- Conda environment solve is also a common factor
  - Conda, by default, does not generate lockfiles
  - Difficult to debug
  - Packages can get yoinked
  - Source-level package managers could be more robust (Spack, Nix, Guix)
    - But Conda is specially supported by Snakemake

- Many plaintext!
- Could be more easily stored and analyzed by registries

# Discussion

## Containers require superuser to install

::: incremental
- Users won't necessarily have root on shared systems
- Rootless user-namespaces exist, but may be too new or not enabled
- Why do we need root to reproduce someone else's code?
  - Linux filesystems are kernel modules, requires root to modify
- Future work could look at CharlieCloud
:::

## Towards an execution description language

::: {.incremental}
- SWC supports a YAML file which says how to run the workflow
- Develop workflow-agnostic way of saying how to run a workflow
  - Stored with the workflow code
  - Could be done by workflow authors or by reproducers
  - Simplify artifact evaluation, CI, reusability, reproducibility

## Continuous integration

::: incremental
- Use current CI scripts
  - If the script multiple targets, which one to use?
  - None of them may actually run the experiment, if it is too expensive to run in CI.
- Use CI script format but write new scripts
  - No way to say **what** the command does
  - Need linked data for that
