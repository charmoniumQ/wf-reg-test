In the first part, Background, we introduce the concept of scientific workflows and set the scene by describing how they differ from their business workflow counterpart. In Part II, Application and User Perspective, we provide a number of scientific examples that currently use workflows for their e-Science experiments. In Workflow Representation and Common Structure (Part III), we describe core workflow themes, such as control flow or dataflow and the use of components or services. In this part, we also provide overviews for a number of common workflow languages, such as Petri Nets, the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), and the Virtual Data Language (VDL), along with service interfaces. In Part IV, Frameworks and Tools, we take a look at many of the popular environments that are currently being used for e-Science applications by paying particular attention to their workflow capabilities. The following four sections describe the chapters in each part and therefore provide a comprehensive summary of the book as a whole.},

	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},
