- Computational experiment runtimes
  - [x] [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io)
  - [x] [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/)
    - [ ] Make sure Conda cache and Singularity cache are disabled.
    - [ ] Run singularity in a tighter container. In the current system, the process can still write to $HOME, I think.
    - [ ] Make sure malicious workflows can do no damage.
    - [ ] Move Conda dirs and Singularity dirs to the same root.
    - [ ] Capture a summary Singularity image files and Conda env without storing the entire thing. This can be useful for provenance, tell me the first difference between their run and mine.
	- [ ] Use cgroups instead of taskste (see also benchexec)
  - [ ] SAW NGW (proprietary)
  - [ ] Galaxy
  - [ ] WDL
  - [ ] Common Workflow Language (CWL)
  - [ ] Pegasus
  - [ ] Makefile

- Tests
  - [x] Repeatable crash-freedom?
  - [x] Parse error messages?
  - [x] Parse output format?
  - [ ] If crashes, repeatable error-message?
  - [ ] If not crashes, repeatable bitwise-equivalent with holding zero, one, two, three, or four of {/dev/{,u}random, datetime, ASL, single-core}?
  - [ ] Repeatable 5--95%-ile interval?

- Code analysis
  - [ ] SLoC by type
  - [ ] Code-to-comment by type
  - [ ] Cyclomatic
  - [ ] Function length distribution
  - [ ] Dependency graph?
      - Imports per file
      - Total transitive dependencies
  - [ ] Component graph?
  - [ ] Similarity of experiments?
  - [ ] Detect presence of best practices?
    - Tools for reproducibility
    - Dependency count, transitive dependency count
	- SLoC count by language, transitive SLoC count by language
    - Documentation to code ratio

- Data analysis assumptions:
  - Assumption: Time symmetry
  - Assumption: Group and problem identity is constant and one-dimensional
  - Assumption: Versions are indistinguishable
    - Except possibly last version?
  - Caveat: predictor != intervention
  - Caveat: predictor only works with unawareness of its use as a predictor
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique
  - Analysis question: Do input variables predict rate of decay or do input variables + staleness predict failure?
  - Analysis question: between levels of reproducibility
    - Set of factors are necessary and sufficient for reproducibility
    - Successful termination
    - {Faketime, fake random, ASLR}
    - Multi-threaded
  - Analysis question: Model infant mortality or constant rate of failure?

- Data analysis:
  - [ ] Measure rate of collapse over time?
      - Coefficient of staleness on successful termination
  - [ ] Predictive accuracy of collapse over time based on staleness, code anaylsis, and optionally history?
      - How to use information from other simultaneously failing workflows?
  - [ ] How effective is each non-determinism mitigation?
    - `R` / `total`
    - `R_easy` / `total`
	- `R_multi` / `total`
    - `R_all` / `total`
  - [ ] Improve efficiency of continuous testing in simulation?
      - Generate time-to-collapse
      - How to use information from other simultaneously failing workflows?
  - [ ] Code best practices
    - Influence of code metrics on decay rate, `R_easy`, (`R_all` given not `R_easy`)
    - Interaction between code metrics on rate of decay?

- Other questions:
  - [ ] Cluster error messages?
  - [ ] Replicate Zhao's categories?
  - [ ] Design automatic fixes?
  - [ ] Outcome preserving input minimization?

  - [ ] How many failures occur in a unit-testable component?
  - [ ] Compositional testing?
