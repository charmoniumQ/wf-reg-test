  description:
    - Began with three hardcoded nf-core workflows
    - Scraped all revisions
    - Ran all revisions with Nix nf-core
    - Note that one of the workflows took more than two hours without using any CPU. Therefore, I killed that one.

    - Retroactively fixed bug where time was not recorded when a workflow failed.
